# Stock Web App

This is a stock web app that allows a user to buy shares, see their transactions they've made, and check stocks in real-time. Uses MongoDB for the database, and Express for the server. Uses IEX API for stock data.

## Takeaways
This app currently doesn't work, but has been a big part of learning Express and databases, as well as using packages like mongoose and ejs. Express routing and getting/posting data, personally, has been the biggest challenge, and so to remedy that, I will be taking time to further explore this part of Express, as well as how to connect different parts of a project together.
